## How to access and execute the addTwoInt.py codes?
Once you have clicked on the link to my git repository to access the project, simply click on the 'main' on the branch menu and select 'dev'. Lastly, click on the addTwoInt.py to see the codes for the project.

If you want to execute the codes, click on the 'Code' beside the 'Add file' from the menu, while still in 'dev' and select 'Download ZIP'. A ZIP file will then be downloaded to your local system which you can extract. Then, right-click on the extracted file and select 'open terminal'. On the linux terminal, type: 'python3 addTwoInt.py arg1 arg2', where arg1 and arg2 are any two numbers of your choice. The script will then be executed to give you the sum of the two values you have provided as arguments. This is how to run the codes of the addTwoInt.py script.
